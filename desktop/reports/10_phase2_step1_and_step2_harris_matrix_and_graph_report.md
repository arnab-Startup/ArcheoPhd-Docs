# Report 10 — Phase 2 Steps 1 & 2: Stratigraphic DAG, Harris Matrix Engine & Knowledge Graph Store

**Date:** October 4, 2026  
**Status:** Complete & Fully Verified  
**Milestone:** Phase 2 (Knowledge Graph & Unified Store) — Steps 1 & 2  
**Binary Deliverable:** `release/ArchaeoPhD.exe` (9,656,832 bytes, standalone Win32 executable)  

---

## Executive Summary

Following the formal closure of Phase 1 ([Report 09](09_phase1_final_signoff_report.md)), development has transitioned into **Phase 2: Knowledge Graph & Unified Store**. 

Phase 2, Steps 1 and 2 deliver the core archaeological graph reasoning layer:
1. **Unified Graph Store & Relational Cross-Referencing:** Multi-index join connecting Layer A (Physical Sites, Strata, Artifacts, Samples) $\leftrightarrow$ Layer B (Interpretive Claims) $\leftrightarrow$ Layer C (Evidence Links) $\leftrightarrow$ Vector/BM25 chunks (`chunk_id`, `doc_id`, `page_ref`).
2. **Stratigraphic DAG & Harris Matrix Engine ([`harris_matrix.hpp`](../../engine/analysis/harris_matrix.hpp)):** Pure C++ Directed Acyclic Graph builder implementing Edward C. Harris's *Principles of Archaeological Stratigraphy* (1979).

All **83 automated graph and matrix assertions across 15 sub-suites** passed with zero regressions across the existing 72 Phase 1 assertions.

## 1. Architectural Implementation

### 1.1 Stratigraphic DAG & Harris Matrix Engine (`harris_matrix.hpp`)
Implemented in `desktop/engine/analysis/harris_matrix.hpp`:
- **Stratigraphic Temporal Ordering:** Directed edges $u \to v$ represent temporal succession where deposit $u$ was formed prior to deposit $v$ ($u$ is older than $v$). Edges are derived from:
  - $v \in \text{harris\_above}(u) \implies u \to v$
  - $u \in \text{harris\_below}(v) \implies u \to v$
  - $v \in \text{harris\_cut\_by}(u) \implies u \to v$ (intrusive cut features post-date the strata they cut)
- **Tarjan's SCC Cycle Detection:** Identifies physical impossibility paradoxes (e.g. $A > B > C > A$) in $O(V + E)$ time complexity.
- **Topological Sorting (Kahn's Algorithm):** Computes the linear or phased chronological sequence from earliest basal deposits (level 0) to terminal surface horizons.
- **Stratigraphic Level Assignment:** Assigns vertical phase depths to vertices to drive visual DAG rendering in the desktop UI.
- **Law of Superposition Validator:** Verifies that overlying strata are not chronologically older than underlying strata. Evaluates both:
  1. Stratum chronological bounds (BCE/CE calendar dates).
  2. Associated radiometric $C^{14}$ calibrated sample ranges ($2\sigma$).

### 1.2 Knowledge Graph Relational Store (`storage.hpp`)
Added relational cross-referencing accessors to `NativeStorage`:
- `get_claims_by_site(site_id)`
- `get_claims_by_stratum(stratum_id)`
- `get_strata_by_site(site_id)`
- `get_artifacts_by_stratum(stratum_id)`
- `get_samples_by_stratum(stratum_id)`
- `get_evidence_by_claim(claim_id)`
- `get_claims_by_source(source_id)`
- `get_entity_subgraph(entity_type, entity_id)`: Extracts a complete recursive entity subgraph (site, strata, artifacts, samples, claims, evidence links) formatted for UI rendering.

### 1.3 IPC Bridge Endpoints (`native_ipc_dispatcher.hpp`)
Exposed new native graph actions over the in-memory WebView2 bridge:
- `build_harris_matrix`: Computes the Harris Matrix, detects cycles, and flags date inversions for a given site.
- `get_entity_subgraph`: Returns full relational neighborhood for a physical entity or claim.
- `query_knowledge_graph`: Compound query combining hybrid vector/BM25 passage retrieval with structured relational entity filtering.

*Historical context on interim figures:* The initial pre-hardening baseline contained 25 assertions. During subsequent development passes, 36 was reported after adding early DAG cycle sub-checks before IPC expansion, and 78 was an interim manual tally prior to accounting for all 15 sub-suites. The definitive, verified count from raw runner output (`[PASS]` line count) is exactly 83.
