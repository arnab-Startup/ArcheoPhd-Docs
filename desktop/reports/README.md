## Standing Architectural Principles Established in Phase 0

1. **"A Blank Field is Safer Than a Plausible-Looking Wrong One"**:
   - The application shall **never pre-fill form fields** with low-confidence or single-engine extractions. Cognitive confirmation bias makes plausible errors (e.g., `1656` instead of `1966`) significantly more dangerous than leaving a blank field for human entry.
2. **Dual-Engine Consensus Safety Gate (PAUSED for Automated Ingestion)**:
   - While dual OCR engines achieve 0.0% shared optical character misreads where the target was present in the window, string-equality consensus does not detect dropped measurement units (5.0%) or displaced adjacent numbers (16.3%). Direct auto-write to the database is therefore **paused** for Class A; all candidate facts route to the human verification queue with source optical crops until Step 4 attribution and unit validation are implemented.
3. **Strict Document Ingestion Gating**:
   - All newly imported documents default to **Class B (Degraded / Manual Transcription)**. Class A requires explicit researcher confirmation. Any document can be re-flagged to Class B with 1 click.
4. **Permanent Manual Transcription for Class B**:
   - Degraded 19th–20th century letterpress with ink bleed-through is permanently routed to split-screen human transcription. No automated ML or assistive pre-fill will be attempted.
