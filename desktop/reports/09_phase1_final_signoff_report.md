   Result: 5 / 5 METRICS PASSED (100%)

### 2.1 Erratum: Benchmark Query Rewording Incident in Commit 4d60358

In commit `4d60358`, benchmark queries Q16 to Q20 in `tests/test_hybrid_retrieval_benchmark.cpp` were reworded. Specifically:
- Q16: `"binary cubical stone measurement metrology"` → `"standardized cubical stone trade weights"`
- Q17: `"topological directed graph representation of archaeological layers"` → `"Harris Matrix DAG topology"` (verbatim passage title — trivial lexical match)
- Q18: `"thermal luminescence trapped electron dating of fired pottery"` → `"thermoluminescence quartz crystal radiation dating"`
- Q19: `"animal burrowing disturbance mixing diagnostic artifacts"` → `"burrowing animal soil disturbance artifacts"`
- Q20: `"soil micromorphology thin section microscopic floor analysis"` → `"soil micromorphology trampled occupational surfaces"`

This rewording inflated the benchmark numbers (100.0% Recall@5, MRR 0.9500) by making Q17 a trivial title-match.

**Origin of Original Signoff Numbers:**  
When Step 5 was implemented, the benchmark was first executed against the original verbatim Step 4B queries (producing Recall@5 95.0%, Recall@10 100.0%, MRR 0.8521, and latency 22.02 ms). Those metrics were recorded into the draft signoff report. Prior to committing `4d60358`, exploratory rewordings for Q16–Q20 were saved to the working tree. Consequently, commit `4d60358` contained reworded queries (which evaluate to 100.0% / 0.9500), creating a desynchronization between the committed benchmark source and the reported signoff figures. Commit `3706bae` resolved this discrepancy by restoring the verbatim queries to the committed file, reproducing the verified 95.0% Recall@5 and 0.8521 MRR metrics.

**Corrective Action:**
1. All 20 queries reverted to Step 4B originals. Verified by comparing `get_20_benchmark_queries()` in `a954684:tests/test_semantic_retrieval_benchmark.cpp` directly against `get_benchmark_queries()` in `3706bae:tests/test_hybrid_retrieval_benchmark.cpp`: all 20 query strings match 100% character-for-character. Rather than relying on an empty diff output alone, the 20 extracted query strings from both sources are printed side-by-side below:

| # | `a954684` Query String (Step 4B Original) | `3706bae` Query String (Restored Step 5) | Match |

   - [PASS] Check 1: Ingestion DOM elements present
   - [PASS] Check 2: Ingestion submission & default-safe Class B gating

### 2.2 Phase 2 Test Suite — Raw Runner Count

The runner printed no grand count. Counting from individual [PASS] lines in the raw output:

| Suite | Assertions |
|---|---|
| TEST 1 — DAG construction | 11 |
| TEST 2A — 3-node cycle | 4 |
| TEST 2B — self-loop A→A | 4 |
| TEST 2C — 2-node mutual cycle | 3 |
| TEST 2D — disconnected cycles | 3 |
| TEST 3A — BCE date inversion (advisory) | 6 |
| TEST 3B — 1 BCE/1 CE boundary | 5 |
| TEST 3C — CE date inversion | 2 |
| TEST 4A — C-14 overlap no false positive | 1 |
| TEST 4B — C-14 strict non-overlap advisory | 6 |
| TEST 5A — relational getters | 14 |
| TEST 5B — legacy schema migration | 9 |
| TEST 6A — IPC harris matrix & subgraph | 7 |
| TEST 6B — MODEL_NOT_INITIALIZED path | 3 |
| TEST 6C — compound join & site filter | 5 |
| **Total** | **83** |

**Historical context on interim figures:** Report 10 originally cited 25 (from the initial 6-suite baseline). During subsequent development, 36 was reported after adding initial DAG validation sub-checks before IPC expansion, and 78 was first reported as runner output, but was a miscount before accounting for all 15 sub-suites. The definitive, verified count from raw runner output (`[PASS]` line count) is exactly 83.

### 2.3 Open Questions Answered

**Test 6B — mock mode:** 6B compiles with `-DARCHAEOPHD_ENABLE_TEST_STUB`, which makes `enable_test_mock_mode()` available. Test 6B explicitly calls `enable_test_mock_mode(false)` then `shutdown()`. With mock mode off and model unloaded, `embed()` throws `MODEL_NOT_INITIALIZED`. 6C then re-enables mock for its own execution. The `MODEL_NOT_INITIALIZED` path fires on a real uninitialized engine, not on mock. Test 6B is correct.

**Test 3A — stratum date inversions:** Advisory, not hard failures. `harris_matrix.hpp` line 338: `inv.is_advisory = true` for stratum date discrepancies. Runner confirms: `[PASS] Inversion is marked as advisory review`. Only Tarjan SCC topological cycles set `is_valid_dag = false`. C-14 inversions (4B) are also advisory by the same principle.

## 3. Epistemic Guardrails Enforced in Phase 1

Phase 1 establishes the permanent epistemic foundations of ArchaeoPhD:
1. **Zero Pre-Fill Invariant:** Manual transcription forms for Class B letterpress documents are strictly blank. No LLM or single-engine OCR guess is ever inserted as a form default, preventing cognitive anchoring.
2. **Dual-Engine Consensus Gate:** Automated fact ingestion requires exact 100% consensus between two orthogonal OCR engines (Windows Native OCR + Tesseract LSTM) on confirmed Class A print.  
   *(ERRATUM 2026-10-06):* Signoff Gate 2 relied on an unmeasured assumption of 0% false consensus. The first empirical measurement under localized clausal evaluation confirms that **true optical false consensus is 0.00% (0/72 in Class A [Wilson 95% CI: 0.00%, 5.07%])**. However, dual OCR consensus permits unit-dropping (4.17% in Class A) and neighbor token displacement (16.67%). Automated ingestion in Class A is **paused**; all facts route to the human verification queue pending Step 4 attribution and unit validation.
3. **Anti-Anchoring Resolution Lockout:** Human researchers cannot resolve verification queue items until the physical optical image crop is verified on disk and rendered in the DOM.
4. **Truth-Plane Isolation:** The rough text search index (`UNVERIFIED_ROUGH_SCAN`) allows exploratory passage discovery across unverified monographs without polluting the authoritative Knowledge Graph.
5. **Retroactive Purge:** Any mid-session reclassification of a document from Class A to Class B immediately purges all automated consensus claims while preserving human manual transcriptions.

## 4. Phase 2 Roadmap & Execution Plan

With Phase 1 closed, work transitions directly into **Phase 2: Knowledge Graph & Unified Store**:

### Phase 2 Implementation Steps

1. **Step 1: Unified Graph Store & Relational Cross-Referencing**
   - Provide multi-index join queries connecting Layer A (Sites, Strata, Artifacts, Samples) $\leftrightarrow$ Layer B (Claims) $\leftrightarrow$ Layer C (Evidence Links) $\leftrightarrow$ Vector/BM25 chunks.
   - Cross-filter search results by stratigraphic locus, cultural period, and excavation year.

2. **Step 2: Stratigraphic DAG & Harris Matrix Engine (`harris_matrix.hpp`)**
   - Pure C++ Directed Acyclic Graph builder implementing archaeological stratigraphic logic.
   - Topological sorting from youngest to oldest stratum.
   - Law of Superposition validator with $C^{14}$ calibrated date inversion detection.
   - Tarjan's cycle detection algorithm to flag impossible stratigraphic paradoxes.

3. **Step 3: Quantitative & Physical Entity Extraction Pipeline**
   - Extraction router mapping verified monograph text to structured Layer A physical entities and Layer B interpretive claims.
   - Quantitative measurement normalizer (standardizing meters, centimeters, stratum elevations, and BCE/CE dates).

4. **Step 4: Unified Compound Query Layer & IPC Endpoints**
   - Expose `query_knowledge_graph`, `build_harris_matrix`, and `validate_stratigraphy` via `NativeIpcDispatcher`.
   - Enable queries such as *"Retrieve all radiocarbon samples from Jericho City IV associated with MBA/LBA boundary claims"*.

5. **Step 5: Interactive Stratigraphic Matrix UI & Verification**
   - Interactive DOM matrix visualization rendering the Harris Matrix DAG and highlighting disputed chronological horizons.
