# Phase 1, Step 4 — Technical Report 07: Vector Persistence, In-Process GGUF Embedding & Retrieval Benchmark

**Author:** ArchaeoPhD Core Team  
**Date:** October 2026  
**Scope:** Phase 1, Step 4 (4A & 4B) Vector Engine Implementation:
1. **Step 4A: Vector Storage Durability & Restart Resilience**:
   - Pure C++ binary disk serialization (`vectors.bin`) with atomic temp-file rename (`.tmp` $\to$ `.bin`).
   - Crash resilience and startup orphan `.tmp` purge.
   - Dual-write failure mode resilience: read-path stability on orphaned vectors (vector without source) and missing vectors (relational source/claims present, vector index empty).
   - Relational ledger primacy: `relational_state.json` retains absolute authority over knowledge-graph truth; search index is strictly candidate-driven.
   - Purge of vestigial LanceDB UI claims from distribution files.
2. **Step 4B: In-Process GGUF Embedding & Semantic Retrieval Benchmark**:
   - Zero-external-daemon architecture: Static in-process GGUF embedding via `llama.cpp` (`nomic-embed-text-v1.5.Q4_K_M.gguf`, SHA-256 verified).
   - 128-dimensional Matryoshka representation learning truncation with guarded L2 normalization (512 bytes per passage chunk).
   - Compile-time exclusion of test mock stub via `#ifdef ARCHAEOPHD_ENABLE_TEST_STUB` (production binary physically cannot fall back to character-frequency hashing).
   - Pre-registered 20-query archaeological retrieval benchmark across 4 excavation corpuses plus methodology texts (50 ground-truth passages):
     - Recall@5: 85.0% (17/20, Wilson 95% Score Interval: [64.0%, 94.8%])
     - MRR@10: 0.7571
     - Average Latency: 23.9 ms
   - Named limitation: Intra-document disambiguation weaker than cross-monograph discrimination; tracked for Step 5 resolution via hybrid lexical/entity filtering alongside cosine similarity.
   - Commit gate rule: Milestone gate met, but production-grade confidence requires re-validation at $n \ge 100$ queries.
3. **End-to-End Live Pipeline Join (Check 9)**:
   - Added native IPC endpoint `extract_archive_text`: reads archived binary from disk via `Source.archive_path` and parses PDF `BT`/`ET` and `Tj`/`TJ` text streams in pure C++.
   - Extended Live UI test suite to 9 checks: verified real PDF ingestion $\to$ lossless archive $\to$ stream extraction $\to$ vector embedding $\to$ semantic search retrieval in an unbroken, live WebView2 run.
   - Scope caveat: Validates that the end-to-end architectural pipe is properly wired; does not substitute for the full Class A/B dual-engine OCR consensus pipeline required for degraded historical scans.

**Implementation Files:**
- `desktop/engine/analysis/embedding_engine.hpp` (In-process GGUF embedding engine, 128-dim Matryoshka truncation, L2 normalization)
- `desktop/engine/analysis/vector_index.hpp` (Quantized vector store, cosine search, binary persistence, compile-time stub gating)
- `desktop/engine/storage/storage.hpp` (Atomic file transactions, startup `.tmp` purge, vector store save/load)
- `desktop/engine/ipc/native_ipc_dispatcher.hpp` (`extract_archive_text` endpoint, `search_semantic_passages`, `index_rough_text`)
- `desktop/src/main.cpp` (Live UI test suite with Check 8 GGUF retrieval and Check 9 end-to-end join)
- `desktop/tests/test_vector_durability.cpp` (8-test durability and dual-write fault tolerance harness)
- `desktop/tests/test_semantic_retrieval_benchmark.cpp` (Pre-registered 20-query archaeological evaluation harness)
- `desktop/tests/test_embed_model.cpp` (Direct GGUF model load, prompt formatting, and dimension check)

**Test Suites:**
- Durability Suite: 8/8 tests passed (100%)
- Retrieval Benchmark Suite: 3/3 hard pre-registered gates passed (100%)
- Live WebView2 UI Automation: 9/9 checks passed (100%)

## 1. Executive Summary & Epistemic Boundaries

Phase 1, Step 4 transitions ArchaeoPhD from mock/stub embeddings to a fully operational, offline-first semantic search engine running directly in-process within the native Windows C++ workstation.

### What is Proven Live
1. **Durability & Restart Resilience (Step 4A)**:
   - `VectorIndex` state persists across complete application process lifecycles via `vectors.bin`.
   - Incomplete writes due to simulated crashes leave `.tmp` files that are automatically swept on startup with zero ledger corruption.
   - Dual-write failure modes (orphaned vectors or missing vectors) do not crash the engine, poison the relational ledger, or emit phantom sources.
2. **In-Process Inference (Step 4B)**:
   - The production executable links `llama.cpp` directly into `release/ArchaeoPhD.exe` (~9.5 MB standalone binary).
   - Zero external daemons, zero HTTP network calls, zero Ollama dependency.
   - Queries and passages are embedded via `nomic-embed-text-v1.5.Q4_K_M.gguf` with Matryoshka truncation to 128 dimensions, requiring only 512 bytes of storage per chunk.
3. **Unbroken Live Join (Check 9)**:
   - The gap between binary ingestion (Checks 1–7) and vector retrieval (Check 8) is closed.
   - In Check 9, a real PDF (`test_live_sample.pdf`) is submitted via the live DOM $\to$ compressed and archived $\to$ extracted via native `extract_archive_text` $\to$ indexed into the vector store $\to$ searched via `search_semantic_passages` $\to$ retrieved with verified source grounding.
   - **Scope Boundary Caveat:** Check 9 strictly proves that the architectural pipe is wired end-to-end (ingest $\to$ archive $\to$ extract $\to$ embed $\to$ search), not that real-world PDF text extraction is production-ready. The lightweight C++ stream-operator scanner (`BT...ET`, `Tj`/`TJ`) validates the pipeline join on text-bearing PDF streams; it does not substitute for the full OCR / Class A/B dual-engine consensus pipeline required for scanned, compressed, or degraded historical letterpress.

## 2. Benchmark Methodology & Statistical Analysis

### Benchmark Dataset
The retrieval benchmark evaluated 50 ground-truth passages spanning 4 classical excavation corpuses plus foundational archaeological methodology texts:
1. **Sankalia (1974)**: *Pre- and Proto-History of India and Pakistan* (Chirki-on-Pravara Acheulian lithics, 10 passages: `chirki_c01`–`c10`).
2. **Kenyon (1981) vs. Wood (1990)**: *Excavations at Jericho / Tell es-Sultan* (Middle/Late Bronze destruction horizon conflict, 10 passages: `jericho_c11`–`c20`).
3. **Yadin (1972)**: *Hazor* (Iron Age stratigraphy & fortifications, 10 passages: `hazor_c21`–`c30`).
4. **Marshall (1931) & Mackay (1938)**: *Mohenjo-daro and the Indus Civilization* (Indus urbanism, architecture, drainage, 10 passages: `indus_c31`–`c40`).
5. **Archaeological Method & Theory**: *Harris (1989), Aitken (1990), Schiffer (1987), Courty (1989)* (Stratigraphy, C-14/TL dating, formation processes, micromorphology, 10 passages: `method_c41`–`c50`).

*Methodological Note:* The corpus was expanded from an initial 3-monograph draft to 4 excavation corpuses plus methodology texts during test suite preparation to ensure balanced thematic coverage across Palaeolithic, Levantine Bronze/Iron Age, South Asian Urban, and stratigraphic/dating theory contexts.

| 14 | `covered municipal sewage drainage system with silt traps` | `indus_c32` | 2 | HIT @3 |
| 15 | `ventilated agricultural storehouse with timber ducting` | `indus_c37` | 2 | HIT @3 |

| 20 | `soil micromorphology thin section microscopic floor analysis` | `method_c49` | 1 | HIT @1 |

*(Note on Query Fields & Subsequent Diagnostic Reports: The benchmark tuple `BenchmarkQuery` consists of `query_text` [Field 1: search string sent to embedding engine], `target_chunk_id` [Field 2], and `description` [Field 3: short diagnostic label]. The table above lists the verbatim `query_text` strings. Diagnostic runner traces in subsequent reports, such as Report 08, print the `description` field [e.g. `"Chirki Elephas and Bos fossil associations"` for Q3] in their logging columns rather than the full query string.)*

### Statistical Discipline: Wilson Score Interval
Evaluating $17/20$ successes yields a point estimate of $85.0\%$. At $n = 20$, the sample size is small; applying the Wilson score interval at the 95% confidence level:

$$w = \frac{\hat{p} + \frac{z^2}{2n} \pm z \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n} + \frac{z^2}{4n^2}}}{1 + \frac{z^2}{n}} \implies [64.0\%,\; 94.8\%]$$

**Significance:**
- The milestone gate ($\ge 85.0\%$) is mathematically satisfied.
- However, because the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is $64.0\%$, **production-grade confidence is not yet claimed**.
- **Commit Gate Rule:** Formal claims of production-grade retrieval performance are barred until re-validation is executed against a benchmark of $n \ge 100$ evaluation queries.

### Failure Analysis: Dense-Only Retrieval Limitations
The 3 queries that failed top-5 retrieval under pure dense cosine search were:
1. **Query 1 (`chirki_c01`)**: Target rank >10. Vocabulary gap: query terms (`"rubble"`, `"biface"`) versus passage terminology (`"boulder conglomerate"`, `"cleaver"`).
2. **Query 2 (`chirki_c04`)**: Target rank 7. Intra-monograph collision: competing Chirki knapping debris passages scored higher on dense embedding similarity.
3. **Query 17 (`method_c41`)**: Target rank >10. Abstract methodological description of Harris Matrix DAGs was overshadowed by generic stratigraphy methodology passages.

**Key Finding:** Pure dense embeddings exhibit intra-document near-neighbor collisions and vulnerability to lexical synonym divergence.
**Forward Plan for Step 5:** Address intra-document ambiguity and lexical misses by layering Okapi BM25 lexical retrieval and Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) alongside dense vector similarity.

## 5. Architectural Principles Confirmed

1. **Relational Ledger Primacy**: The vector index is strictly a query discovery accelerator. If a vector exists without a relational record, the knowledge graph ignores it. If a relational record exists without a vector, all UI tables and contradiction logic remain 100% functional.
2. **Compile-Time Stub Exclusion**: Production releases must not contain mock hash fallback paths. If the model file is missing or invalid, the engine fails explicitly rather than generating plausible nonsense.
3. **No Uninspected Auto-Commit**: Uninspected OCR text indexed for search discovery remains strictly isolated under `UNVERIFIED_ROUGH_SCAN` and is never treated as verified factual claims.
4. **Air-Gapped In-Process Autonomy**: Embedding inference requires no external daemons, no open ports, and no internet access.
