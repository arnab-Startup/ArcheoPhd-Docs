# Phase 1, Step 3 — Technical Report 06: Native UI Integration & Workflow Guardrails

**Author:** ArchaeoPhD Core Team  
**Date:** October 2026  
**Scope:** Phase 1, Step 3 Native UI Integration across the 4 Core Workflows:
1. Ingestion Screen (`showIngestionModal`): Native Win32 File Picker, SHA-256 Lossless Archival Display, and Default-Safe `CLASS_B` / `UNVERIFIED_ROUGH_SCAN` Gating
2. Classification Dialog (`showClassificationModal`): Modern Offset (`CLASS_A`) vs. Degraded Letterpress (`CLASS_B`), Strict Physical Inspection Checkbox (`confirmed_clean_offset`), and 1-Click Reflag to Class B with Retroactive Claim Purge
3. Verification Queue View (`showVerificationQueueModal`): Side-by-Side Dual-Engine Discrepancy Cards, Optical Crop Presentation (`crop_image_path`), and Anti-Anchoring Resolution Lockout (Resolution Strictly Disabled When Crop Evidence is Missing)
4. Manual Transcription View (`showManualTranscriptionModal`): Full Split-Screen Scan Viewer + Blank Transcription Form Enforcing the Strict Zero Pre-Fill Epistemic Invariant ("A blank field is safer than a plausible-looking wrong one"), Dynamic Fact Rows, and Provenance-Stamped Commit (`origin_type: "manual_transcription"`)

**Implementation Files:**
- `desktop/dist/ingestion-workflow.js` (Vanilla JS + Scoped CSS UI Controller, ArchaeoPhD Design System tokens, Floating Quick-Action Dock, and DOM Observer)
- `desktop/dist/index.html` (Native entrypoint bundling `data-root-dialog.js` and `ingestion-workflow.js`)
- `desktop/engine/storage/data_root.hpp` (`DataRootManager::BrowseForFile` Win32 OpenFileName implementation)
- `desktop/engine/ipc/native_ipc_dispatcher.hpp` (`browse_file` endpoint with headless test bypass)
- `desktop/engine/validation/benchmark_seed.hpp` (Seeded discrepancy items with physical optical crops and unlinked anti-anchoring test cases)
- `desktop/build.bat` (Added `-lcomdlg32` link flag, packaged `dist/` into `payload.zip` embedded in PE resource)

**Test Suite:** `desktop/tests/test_ipc_webview2_bridge.cpp` (Expanded to 24 tests, 100% passing)  
**Production Binary:** `desktop/release/ArchaeoPhD.exe` (3,603,456 bytes, MinGW-w64 G++ C++20 static release)  
**Live UI Automation:** `desktop/live_ui_test_results.log` (All 7 live WebView2 DOM assertions passed 100%)

## 1. Executive Summary & Test Verdict

Phase 1, Step 3 completes the native user interface layer bridging archaeological researchers to the C++ vector search and contradiction analysis engine. In accordance with the project's core epistemic requirements, all UI workflows are grounded in physical evidence verification and defensive defaults:

1. **Ingestion Screen**:
   - Researchers can select documents via a text path or the native Windows file picker (`browse_file` via `GetOpenFileNameW`).
   - All newly ingested literature defaults strictly to **Class B (Degraded Letterpress)** under an amber `UNVERIFIED_ROUGH_SCAN` status.
   - Computes and displays the SHA-256 cryptographic checksum, original vs. compressed byte sizes, and compression ratio.
   - Storage hard-gate prevents automated claim insertion while in Class B.

2. **Classification Dialog**:
   - Clarifies the epistemic distinction between Clean Modern Offset (`CLASS_A`) and Degraded Letterpress (`CLASS_B`).
   - For `CLASS_A` promotion: The UI strictly disables the promotion button until the researcher manually checks:
     `[x] I have physically inspected this document scan and confirm it is clean modern offset printing without letterpress irregularities, broken type, or ink bleed-through.`
   - Type-safe payload transmission (`confirmed_clean_offset: true` boolean) guarantees defense against string or integer coercion attacks.
   - For existing `CLASS_A` documents: Provides a 1-click **Reflag to Class B** action that triggers retroactive purging of automated consensus claims while preserving manual human transcription.

3. **Verification Queue View**:
   - Queries `get_verification_queue` and renders discrepancy cards with side-by-side Windows OCR vs. VLM consensus candidates.
   - Renders the high-resolution physical scan crop (`crop_image_path`) directly above candidate options.
   - **Anti-Anchoring Resolution Lockout**: Candidate resolution buttons default to `disabled`. The DOM dynamically requires physical optical crop rendering (`naturalWidth > 0`). When an optical crop is missing, corrupt, or unrenderable on disk, candidate resolution buttons (`Accept Candidate A`, `Accept Candidate B`, `Manual Override`) are strictly locked with an amber lockout notice:
     *"ANTI-ANCHORING LOCKOUT: Visual optical crop is missing. Candidate resolution is strictly locked without visual evidence to prevent cognitive anchoring. You may only reject this item."*
   - Engine-level hard-gate (`resolve_verification_item`) independently verifies physical file existence and non-zero bytes on disk (`std::filesystem::exists` and `file_size > 0`), rejecting candidate resolution attempts without optical evidence. Only `Reject Item` remains enabled, preventing researchers from guessing or falling prey to machine confirmation bias.

4. **Manual Transcription View**:
   - Full split-screen interface: high-resolution scan viewer on the left, blank transcription form on the right.
   - **Strict Zero Pre-Fill Invariant**: Calls `get_transcription_template` (which enforces `prefill_enabled: false`) and renders blank fact rows. Machine OCR guesses are forbidden from pre-populating fields.
   - Researchers transcribe verified entities (measurements, strata, loci, artifacts, dates).
   - Committing invokes `save_manual_transcription`, stamping claims with `origin_type: "manual_transcription"` and `verification_status: "VERIFIED"`.

5. **Aesthetic Excellence & Seamless Docking**:
   - Styled with ArchaeoPhD design tokens (`Fraunces` heading font, `Inter` body font, `ui-monospace` for hashes and locus IDs, `hsl(var(--primary))` terracotta/amber accents, `hsl(var(--card))` parchment/obsidian cards).
   - Includes a discreet, floating quick-action dock (`🏛️ Ingest`, `📋 Verify (N)`, `✍️ Transcribe`) and a DOM observer injecting direct actions into `/library` source cards.

## 3. UI Component Architecture & Invariant Enforcement

### 3.1 View 1: Ingestion Screen (`showIngestionModal`)

| Feature | Invariant / Specification | Implementation in `ingestion-workflow.js` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Native File Picker** | Must allow choosing `.pdf` files without browser `fakepath` truncation. | Dispatches `callNative('browse_file')` $\rightarrow$ Win32 `GetOpenFileNameW`. Auto-populates real Windows file path. |
| **Default-Safe Degradation** | Newly ingested literature must never be eligible for automated claim injection. | Automatically labeled `CLASS_B` and `UNVERIFIED_ROUGH_SCAN`. Alerts researcher with amber warning banner. |
| **Lossless Archival Integrity** | Verification that original scan bytes are preserved bit-for-bit. | Computes and displays SHA-256 checksum with 1-click clipboard copy button, byte counts, and compression savings percentage. |
| **Next Action Routing** | Seamless handoff to classification or manual double-entry. | Offers direct triggers to *"Review & Classify Source"* or *"Open Manual Transcription"*. |

### 3.2 View 2: Classification Dialog (`showClassificationModal`)

| Feature | Invariant / Specification | Implementation in `ingestion-workflow.js` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Two-Tier Model** | Clean separation of Modern Offset vs. Degraded Letterpress. | Comparative cards explaining why pre-1970 letterpress requires strict manual double-entry. |
| **Physical Print Checkbox** | `confirmed_clean_offset` must be explicitly verified by a human. | Promotion button is strictly disabled (`pointer-events: none; opacity: 0.45;`) until checkbox is checked. |
| **Strict Type Safety** | Must transmit strict boolean `true`, not string `"true"`. | Dispatches `{ confirmed_clean_offset: true }`, passing backend type-check in `NativeIpcDispatcher`. |
| **1-Click Reflag & Purge** | Immediate revocation of automated claims if letterpress irregularities are spotted. | Prominent crimson button *"Reflag to Class B & Purge Automated Claims"*, prompting user confirmation and triggering `reflag_source_class`. |

### 3.3 View 3: Verification Queue View (`showVerificationQueueModal`)

| Feature | Invariant / Specification | Implementation in `ingestion-workflow.js` & C++ Engine |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discrepancy Presentation** | Side-by-side comparison of Windows OCR vs. VLM consensus. | Displays context snippet, field type, Candidate A, and Candidate B with audit explanation. |
| **Optical Crop Anchor** | Visual evidence is mandatory for verification. | Renders physical scan crop image (`/crops/crop_2040_raw.png`, `/crops/crop_694_raw.png`) in an illuminated frame. |
| **Dual Anti-Anchoring Lockout** | Inability to resolve candidates when crop evidence is absent or unrenderable. | **UI Layer**: Candidate buttons default to disabled; dynamically registers `load` and `error` listeners; unlocks only when `naturalWidth > 0`. Missing/unrenderable crops render amber lockout banner.<br>**Engine Hard-Gate**: `resolve_verification_item` validates physical file existence and non-zero bytes on disk (`std::filesystem::exists` and `file_size > 0`). Candidate resolutions without optical evidence are rejected. Only `Reject Item` remains enabled. |
| **Resolution Dispatch** | Commits chosen resolution to native storage. | Dispatches `resolve_verification_item` with `CANDIDATE_A`, `CANDIDATE_B`, `MANUAL_OVERRIDE`, or `REJECT`. |

| Feature | Invariant / Specification | Implementation in `ingestion-workflow.js` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Split-Screen Layout** | High-resolution physical scan viewer alongside transcription form. | 60/40 viewport split with canvas rendering, zoom controls, and page navigation (`Prev` / `Next`). |
| **Zero Pre-Fill Invariant** | "A blank field is safer than a plausible-looking wrong one." | Queries `get_transcription_template` (`prefill_enabled: false`) and renders empty input rows. Machine OCR guesses are prohibited from appearing in the fields. |
| **Dynamic Fact Rows** | Arbitrary archaeological claims per page. | Dynamic row creation: Entity Name, Measurement/Text Value, and Type selector (`measurement`, `stratum`, `locus`, `artifact`, `date`). |
| **Ground-Truth Commit** | Provable provenance in the knowledge graph. | Dispatches `save_manual_transcription`. Engine records claims with `origin_type: "manual_transcription"` and `verification_status: "VERIFIED"`. |

## 4. Live Windows WebView2 Execution & DOM Click-Through Verification

To eliminate simulation blind spots and empirically prove that the actual rendered JavaScript in `ingestion-workflow.js` operates the IPC contracts and enforces all UI invariants correctly, an automated live UI test suite (`--test-ui-live`) was executed against the running standalone `release/ArchaeoPhD.exe` hosting the real Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime.

### 4.1 Live DOM Test Execution Command

```powershell
PS D:\Prorgram\Project\ArcheoPhd\desktop> Start-Process .\release\ArchaeoPhD.exe -ArgumentList "--test-ui-live" -Wait
PS D:\Prorgram\Project\ArcheoPhd\desktop> Get-Content .\live_ui_test_results.log
```

### 4.3 Detailed DOM Assertion Analysis

| Step | Verification Area | Target DOM Invariant | Live Execution Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Ingestion Screen | Form controls (`#apd-wf-filepath-input`, `#apd-wf-title-input`, `#apd-wf-submit-btn`) render properly in live WebView2 DOM. | **PASS**: All inputs mounted and interactive in live Chromium frame. |
| **2** | Ingestion Gating | Newly ingested document receives SHA-256 cryptographic stamp, copy button, and defaults strictly to `CLASS_B` / `UNVERIFIED_ROUGH_SCAN`. | **PASS**: Immutable cryptographic hash rendered; storage hard-gate active. |
| **3** | Classification Modal | Promotion button `#apd-wf-promote-btn` is disabled by default; unlocks ONLY upon checking `#apd-wf-confirm-clean-offset`; re-locks immediately if unchecked. | **PASS**: Physical inspection checkbox guardrail verified across full toggle cycle. |
| **4** | Queue (Valid Crop) | Verification item with valid optical crop (`/crops/crop_2040_raw.png`) successfully loads, confirms `naturalWidth > 0`, and unlocks Candidate A resolution button. | **PASS**: Visual evidence presence permits candidate resolution. |
| **5** | Queue (Missing Crop) | Verification item with missing optical crop (`/crops/missing_crop_9999.png`) triggers Anti-Anchoring Lockout banner and strictly disables candidate buttons; `Reject Item` remains enabled. | **PASS**: Anti-anchoring lockout prevents machine confirmation bias. |
| **6** | Manual Transcription | Split-screen scanner renders empty input fields (`prefill_enabled: false`); machine OCR guesses are strictly prohibited from pre-populating fields. | **PASS**: Zero pre-fill epistemic invariant verified in live DOM. |
| **7** | Manual Transcription | User transcribes double-entry facts and commits via `save_manual_transcription`; engine records claims with `origin_type: "manual_transcription"`. | **PASS**: Ground-truth commit confirmed with success notification. |
